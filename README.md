## What is Github Sponsors?

When you are building a website, chances are that you are using a css framework
like Bootstrap, Materializecss, Foundation, etc... But you will only use a small
set of the framework and a lot of unused css styles will be included.

This is where Purgecss comes into play. Purgecss analyzes your content and your
css files. Then it matches the selectors used in your files with the one in your
content files. It removes unused selectors from your css, resulting in smaller
css files.
