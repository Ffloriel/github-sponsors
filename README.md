## What is Github Sponsors?

GitHub Sponsors has been announced during Github Satellite at Berlin May 23rd. It is a new way for open source developers to collect donation from the community.
A few ways to do that already exists, but GitHub Sponsors is taking responsibility in this area by adding this feature directly on GitHub.
You can add a Sponsor button on the top of your projects and it will open a popup window containing links to the donation pages.

This package allows open source maintainers to print a post-install message easily for their packages. `github-sponsors` is using FUNDING.yml to retrieve the information and displaying it to the user.


## Getting Started

### Installation

```
npm install --save github-sponsors
```

### Usage

Add in package.json:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "github-sponsors"
  }
}
```
