# GitHub

GitHub Sponsors has been announced during Github Satellite at Berlin May 23rd. It is a new way for open source developers to collect donation from the community.
A few ways to do that already exists, but GitHub Sponsors is taking responsibility in this area by adding this feature directly on GitHub.
You can add a Sponsor button on the top of your projects and it will open a popup window containing links to the donation pages.

::: tip
GitHub will match contributions up to $5,000 during a developerâ€™s first year in GitHub Sponsors with the GitHub Sponsors Matching Fund.
:::

::: tip
GitHub will not charge fees for GitHub Sponsors and will cover payment processing costs for the first year.
