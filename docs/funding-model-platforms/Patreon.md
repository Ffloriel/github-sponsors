# Patreon

Patreon is a platform that allows creators to receive recurring revenue from their fans.
Patreon is not specifically made for open source developers. The platform is used by podcasters, video creators, musicians and creators of all kind.

> Membership is a relationship between you and your most engaged fans â€” the ones that choose to go a level deeper than just following you on social media. They become paying patrons in exchange for exclusive benefits you offer.

When creating a Patreon profile, you will be able to set up different tiers.
You can see the following Patreon as an example: [https://www.patreon.com/evanyou](https://www.patreon.com/evanyou)

Tiers differs from open source developers, but you can often find the following categories:
- Backer
- Bronze Sponsor
- Silver Sponsor
- Gold Sponsor

Each member that makes a reccuring payment receive a benefit depending on the tier.
As an example of a benefit, the name of your sponsors can be listed in a specific file of your project (`Backers.md`) or in a specific repository (`sponsors`).
